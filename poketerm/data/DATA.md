## Info about Pokemon Data
Pokemon base stats, typings, names, and pokedex entries were taken from PokemonDB's [text file generator](https://pokemondb.net/tools/text-list)

All other data about Pokemons' abilities, learnable moves, move stats and certain side effects and available items were all taken from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

If you were wondering why I did it this way, I did not know PokeAPI was open source and had all of it's data available when I started this project so I created scripts to scrape this info from their web API. In the future I may clone
and construct the sqlite DB myself and add it to Gokemon.
